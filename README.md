# Policing_Dataset_EDA
This is my first EDA on any dataset. In this notebook I have done eda on a policing dataset of Rhode Island. Source - https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/
I have done some basic eda like, dropping the irrelevant column(state) and a column with more than 90% data with null values.
The complete eda is divided into 3 parts. In first part, I have analysed various aspects of policing by keeping gender as a primary factor. 
In second part I have done the across the driver's race.
Finally, I have done some other analysis like identifying overall stop duration, rise in drugs related stops and peak arrest rate hours.
I am still learning and this is first independent analysis. Looking forward to valuable feedbacks.
