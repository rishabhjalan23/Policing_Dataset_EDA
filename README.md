# Policing_Dataset_EDA
This is my first EDA on any dataset. In this notebook I have done eda on a policing dataset of Rhode Island. Source - https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/
I have done some basic eda like, dropping the irrelevant column(state) and a column with more than 90% data with null values.
The complete eda is divided into 3 parts. In the first part I have analysed various aspects of policing by keeping gender as a primary factor. 
In the second part I have done across the driver's race.
Finally, I have done some other analyses like identifying overall stop duration, rise in drug-related stops, and peak arrest rate hours.
I am still learning and this is first independent analysis. Looking forward to valuable feedbacks.
